An app that lets people view and vote on cheesy jokes.
To generate jokes, I use the ICanHazDadJoke API.
When the page loads, it should fetch 10 jokes.
Along with a “vote-up” button, a “vote-down” button, and the net score for each joke.
Users can vote, and the net score should update.
There are no duplicate jokes shown.
The jokes sorted by net score, and update this as the scores change.
The list of jokes, with votes is stored in local storage.
The user should still be able to generate new jokes via the button, and these new jokes should replace the ones in local storage.
